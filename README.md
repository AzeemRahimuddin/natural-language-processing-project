# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

The PasswordChecker application is designed to evaluate the strength of user-generated passwords by analyzing their components and comparing them against common patterns or weaknesses. The goal of the application is to help users improve their password security by identifying common, weak, or easily guessable passwords and suggesting improvements to create a stronger password. It performs an analysis of the password based on several criteria, including the presence of symbols, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.

## NLP Techniques

The PasswordChecker project uses pattern matching and text classification as important NLP techniques. Methods like checkForSymbols, checkForNumbers, checkForUpperCase, and checkForLowerCase identify specific elements in the password by comparing each character against predefined lists (symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters). confirmPassword classifies the password as either common or uncommon by checking it against a list of frequently used passwords. These techniques are necessary to analyze the password’s strength and suggest improvements for stronger security.
